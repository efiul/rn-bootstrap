This project was created according to the following video:

Bootstrapping a React Native Project in 2020
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqO9EGvt-kU&feature=youtu.be

1. Creating an empty project with expo and TypeScript
After the following command, choose "blank (TypeScript)"
> expo init rn-bootstrap

2. Configuring TypeScript
After creaing the project, open it and edit tsconfig.json (I did the same as the video recommend - may be very strict)
> cd rn-bootstrap
> code .

3. Configuring eslint
As recommended in the video, I took the configuration from:
https://github.com/wcandillon/eslint-config-react-native-wcandillon

in order to install, run:
> yarn add eslint eslint-config-react-native-wcandillon --dev
I had to install yarn using:
> npm install -g yarn

* Create .eslintrc file and update according to the video.
* In the video, everytime the file is saved, the prettier fixes the  errors - haven't done that yet.
* Added 2 commands in package.json, one to run eslint, one to run TypeScript

4. Install react-native-reanimated 
That's what he is doing in the video...
